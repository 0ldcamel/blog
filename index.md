Embarking on the journey to find the right university or college for my nephew has been both exciting and challenging. As he nears the end of high school, we’ve been exploring various options to ensure he finds a place that not only matches his academic interests but also feels like home.  
As we narrow down the options, we’re excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. This journey has not only been about finding the right school but also about supporting him in making one of the most important decisions of his life. We’re confident that with careful consideration and a bit of adventure, he’ll find the perfect place to start his next chapter.
