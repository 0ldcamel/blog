Join me as I embark on the adventure of learning to code later in life. This blog chronicles my experiences, challenges, and successes as I navigate the world of programming. Whether you’re young or old, a beginner or experienced, I hope to inspire others with my journey of continuous learning and growth. Let’s prove that it’s never too late to pick up a new skill and keep pushing boundaries!
