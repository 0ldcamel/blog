Today, I took a big step in my coding journey. I stumbled upon [an amazing tutorial](https://github.com/skills/github-pages?target="_blank") that walked me through creating a blog hosted on GitHub for free. With clear instructions, I learned how to set up GitHub Pages, choose a theme (the only one), and customize my blog. It was surprisingly straightforward, and now, I have a live blog to share my coding experiences!

If you're thinking about starting your own blog, I highly recommend checking out this tutorial - it's easier than you might think!
